# MNIST Digit Generator Using GANs

### This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed to generate images resembling handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of GANs in learning and replicating complex distributions, such as those of handwritten digit images.

## Project Overview
### The GAN implemented here consists of two main components:

Discriminator (D): A neural network that classifies images as real (from MNIST) or fake (generated by the generator).
Generator (G): A neural network that generates images from a random noise vector, aiming to produce images that are indistinguishable from real MNIST digits by the discriminator.
The training process involves alternating between updating the discriminator, to better differentiate real and fake images, and updating the generator, to better fool the discriminator.
